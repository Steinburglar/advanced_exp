"""A Python script containing functions to allow for the SECOND stage of analysis in the millikan oil drop experiment.
The functions here start from a point of having arrays of charges and the uncertainty in said charges, and will include functions to 
plot ideograms, cluster charges based on those ideograms, and plot the clusters in a linear fit, using a weighted average
of the charges in the cluster

***ths script may also include a packaging function to pull together disperate csv's with charge data, and report back as one N*2 array.
